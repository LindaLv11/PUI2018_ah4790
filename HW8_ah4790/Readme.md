# Caption:
This plot shows the amount of refuse collected by the New York City Department of Sanitation from each borough during the time frame from August 2017 to August 2018.
Despite having the least number of residents, Staten Island has the most refuse collected, while Manhattan, which has far more people, is at the bottom with the Bronx.
The plot also shows possible seasonality in refuse collection as there is a small dip during the winter and then an increase in the summer.

# Overview:
In assignment 1, I collected sanitation data and created a graphic (shown above).
In assignment 2, I, along with Sarah Sachs, reviewed our Citibike analysis from earlier and performed a statistical analysis to test our hypothesis. Here is a link to the report: https://www.authorea.com/users/249361/articles/335431-citibike-analysis
