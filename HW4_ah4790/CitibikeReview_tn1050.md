HW4 - Assignment 1

a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly <br>
Andrew's hypothesis, which I assume to be his alternate hypothesis, as well as his null hypothesis has formed correctly. His idea assumes that the time it takes to 'explore' with a citibike would take longer than the average commute to and from work. I think he should take into account how the day passes and the single ride (which are categorized as 'customers') have a 30 minute time limit per ride while the annual membership (which are categorized as 'subscriber') has a 45 minute time limit per ride. This could give the data a skew in the data seeing as the customer type rides have a shorter time limit than the subscriber type rides. This time limit might have also have its flaws since users might do an overlay and do multiple ride trips to extend their time riding the citibike. It would help if we have the user id for each ride, but unfortunately we do not.


b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)<br>
The extracted values seem to have the right values needed for the hypothesis test.

c. chose an appropriate test to test _H0_ given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.<br>
I think the correlations, such as the Pearson test would be sufficient for this hypothesis test. Since the IV is between customers and subscriber, and DV of the average trip duration.
