## Scope of the Homework:
### Assignment 1:
In assignment 1, I investigated the central limit theorem. For the normal, poisson, binomial, chi-squared, and exponential distributions, I generated 100 random samples of varying sizes but with the same population mean. For each distribution, I created graphs that illustrated how the sample means of larger samples converged towards the overall population mean.

### Assignment 2:
In assignment 2, I asserted the null hypothesis that Citibike subscribers have shorter trip durations than customers. I then pulled data from their website, cleaned that data, and presented a data visualization of the differences in trip duration for each group

### Assignment 3:
In assignment 3, I tested the hypothesis that the new route improved circulation, which, in turn, shortened trip rides. Knowing the population mean and standard deviation of trip times, I was able to conduct a z-test with a sample of the shorter rides and came to the conclusion that indeed the new route improved circulation.

## Acknowledgements:
I worked with Sarah Sachs on Assignment 2, where we created the hypothesis statement and also wrote the code to pull, clean and visualize the data
